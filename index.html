    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>I've always loved technology and tinkering with things.  In 7th grade, I programmed my own game, a simple text-only combat module for an RPG in TI basic on a TI-86.  Unfortunately, this event turned out to be very demoralizing for me and turned me off from programming for a while; I was unaware that, at the time, TI graphing calculators used flash memory so, when the I had to change the batteries on my calculator, the calculator's memory was wiped and I lost my game.  My little 7th grader's spirit was crushed.</p>

    <p>After graduating from high school I decided that I wanted to learn ancient Greek so that I could read the New Testament in its original langauge, a dialect of ancient greek called "koine" meaning 'common'.  As part of learning this language I had to learn all the different accentuation patterns in the language since written ancient Greek often included diacritics, or marks, for accentuation.  The classic approach for this task, endorsed by my text book, was the mass-memorization of every pattern, all 18 or so of them.  However, one of the graduate students teaching the course thought that such an approach was ridiculous, and instead at lunch taught us a process that could <i>generate</i> all of patterns.  I found the task of looking at complicated data, such as the patterns of a language, and coming up with theoretic models that could accurately derive that data wonderful and beautiful.  This started me down the road of studying linguistics, specifically linguistic theory.</p>

    <p>However, while receiving a masters degree from NYU and working towards my PhD thesis in linguistics I gradually (and painfully) came to realize that the academic lifestyle was not a good fit for me.  This, combined with my experience on the fencing team at Princeton and leading Bible Study groups at NYU, made me realize that I prefer faster paced, more structured and team oriented environments where I’m working towards visible results.</p>

	<p>I think that being a developer would combine my love of solving logical problems with the type of environment I would thrive in.  I’ve enjoyed the small exposure that I’ve had to development where my studies and research have touched computational aspects, and I’ve also enjoyed talking to my twin brother about his work as a technical lead at an algorithmic hedge fund and later a product manager at Google.</p>

        <p>
            I've always liked owls. But by accident I came to be associated with owls even more amongst my friends and family.</p>

        <p>It started when I spent a summer studying archaeology in Greece with the American School of Classical Studies, the organization which runs the American archaeological excavations in Greece. I wanted to get souvenirs for my friends and family, so since I spent a lot of time in Athens, I figured I'd get them owl souvenirs. The owl is the symbol of Athena, the patron diety of Athens before Christianity came, and thus a symbol for Athens as well. In fact ancient Athenian coins had a depiction of an owl.</p>

        <p>However, my friends and family didn't understand this connection and just thought I was obsessed with owls. I've explained it to them since but the connection was already made and its stuck.</p>

        <p>I've ran with it ever since.</p>
